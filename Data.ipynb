    "## How to make sense of neural big data\n",
    "\n",
    "Technological advances have enabled large-scale data about the structure, activities, and functions of the brain. To utilize such large data sets, utilization of not only classic statistics but also scalable machine learning algorithmss are crucial.\n",
    "But what algorithm should we use? It depends on the purpose of your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization:** The first step of analysis is usually data visualization to grasp the features of the data. Visuallization can often allows you to realize any problems in your data acquisition, such as noise and missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorization:** A typical way of data analysis is to divide them into a number of categories and characterize each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Components:** In some cases, the data may be composed of a number of components. Unsupervised learning algorithms can be used for extracting such components and then we can characterize each component and the weights of components for each neuron, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation and Causality:** We often want to see the relationship between sensory inputs, neural activities, and motor responses. Taking a linear correlation across those variables is a common way. There are also methods for inferring causal direction of relationships across varibles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoding and Decoding:** A single neuron can represent multiple sensory or motor variables. Conversely, a single variables may be represented by a population of neurons. To address many-to-one or many-to-many relationships, multiple regression can be used for information encoding analysis of single neurons and information decoding analysis from a population neuorns.\n",
    "Their relationship may also be highly nonlinear. In such a case, the use of deep neural networks is also an option.\n",
