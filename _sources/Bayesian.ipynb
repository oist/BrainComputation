    "Our life is full of uncertainty. In sensory perception, we need to cope with noise, delay and occulusion and also overcome fundamental ill-posedness, such as to identify the 3D location of your target from 2D retinal images or sounds to two ears.\n",

    "To find a practical solution to such ill-posed problems, we need to make use of some prior assumptions, such as the light usually comes from the top or objects don't jump abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian inference provides a principled way for combining any prior knowledge with sensory evidence. Indeed there are several lines of psychological evidence suggesting that humans and animals integrate knowledge from prior experience or multi-modal sensory information as predicted by Bayesian inference (Knill & Pouget 2004, Doya et al. 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ernst & Banks (2002) tested in a grasping task in a virtual reality setting how human subjects' object size perception depends on the noise level in the visula feedback. They showed that as the viaual noise increases, subjects' responses are closer to the size estimated by the haptic input, consistently with the ratio of the variances or visual and haptic perception as predicted by the Bayesian theory of multisensory integration.\n",

    "* Kording & Wolpert (2004) tested in an arm reaching task with modified visual feedback how the prior expectation based on repeated trials is combined with visual feedback of different clarities upon each trial. They showed that the subjects' performance was based more on the visual feedback for higher clarity, as expected from Bayesian integration of the prior and likehihood by their variances.\n",

    "> This is a study by Hewitson et al. (2018) following the experiment by Wolpert & Koerding (2004). As the subject tries to move the cursor to the target, a random shift is introduced to the hand-to-curs mapping. The subjects acquire a prior distribution of the cursor shift from experience, and combine that with sensory feedback with different clarities in the middle of reaching. They confirmed that the subjects' performance followed the predicted by Bayesian inference and further showed that the performace generalize across the arm used (from Hewitson et al. 2018)."

Bayesian decoding of neural population activity by the method of Ma et al. (2006) showed that the inferred goal distance reduced even while auditory feedback was turned off, presumably by using action-dependent state transition model, and the variace of the goal distance was reduced as the auditory feedback was turned on again, similar to the feature of dynamic Bayesian inference.\n",
