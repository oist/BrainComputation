    "\n",
    "* __Learning__: Learning can happen very quickly. An infant learns new objects and words everyday. There are some type of learning that takes longer, such as sophisticated motor skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Meta-learning__: After we learn one skill, such as skiing, it helps learning a new skill, such as snowboarding, even though the required muscle outputs are quite different. This suggests that the brain has the capability for \"learning to learn\" or meta-learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Imitation and cultural evolution__: Mimicking what others do seems like a simple job, but it actually involves sophisticated computation for mapping the vision of other's movement to own body movements. Even more importantly, imitation is the basis for cultural evolution, by which skills and knowledge can continue to progress beyond inidvidual's lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Development__: The brain's neral circuit follows a standard course of development, from embryo to newborn and child to adult. Although the number of neurons in the brain is almost constant after birth, there appears to be genetic and epigenetic mechanisms to regulated how learning goes on in different parts of the brain at different stages of maturation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Evolution__: All those mechanims for adaptation of the brain is defined in the genome, which is a product of millions of years of evolution. Simple animals tend to have small brains speciallized for particular behaviors in particular environments, but can adapt rapidly to new environments by producing many offsprings in relatively short life cycles. Vertabrates, especially mammals, can adapt to a wid range of environments within a lifetime using higher capability of learning. "
